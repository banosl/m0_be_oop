# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  - This was a lot of fun! I felt like I had enough know how to figure out how to execute the code that was requested in the challenge. I do wonder about the lest exercise with class Hobbit. I want to see how I can utilize if statements in a different way that doesn't require defining a method in order to adjust an attribute. In particular I'm thinking about the is adult and is old attributes. It may be that I would have to make those attributes dynamic.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  - It's going alright. I felt like I was on par with the course at times, ahead at others, and then running to keep up at other times. I think it's because the weekends felt so long in between sessions that I felt that I had too much time and then not enough time in between sessions separated by one day. Reflecting on this, I have to make sure that I keep to the schedule I put together so that I can keep a decent pace.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  - As mentioned above it's going to primarily require that I keep a steady pace outside of class times so that I keep up with assignments. I don't want to have to be rushing to meet deadlines as that will only add stress to myself and possibly teammates. I will build off of the schedule I started for Mod 1 at the start of this mod. I can add more detail and give myself time to do assignments now that I have an idea of how long they take.
